# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio which is based on projects that I've completed for self learning and hobby purposes. The projects are selected based on topics that interest me in combination with coding skills that I want to develop. 

## Projects
### [Housing Prices in Cyprus](https://github.com/spyrou-andre/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/House-Prices/Jupyter_Notebook_Code.ipynb) 
This project is based on two datasets which I created from a web scraper. I've used the web scraper to harvest housing prices from a Cypriot website that contains listings from multiple Developer sites across Cyprus. The first dataset contains data for House prices and the second about Apartment/Flat prices, both datasets cover listings across all Cypriot districts.
